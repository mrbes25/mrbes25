### _From working hands-on with pianos to solving problems in C and C++, I’ve always enjoyed tackling challenges and working with precision._


### A bit about me:
- 🎯 Studying Software Engineering at **42 Lausanne** **➛** learning by doing\
- 🎹 7+ years as a piano technician **➛** precision, patience, and problem-solving\
- 🖥️ Coding in C/C++ **➛** performance, memory, control\
- 🤝 Collaboration > competition **➛** better together\
- 🧭 Ethics & responsibility **➛** in tech, in community, in craft\
- 🧘 Patience **➛** learned from tuning pianos, applies to debugging too
